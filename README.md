# CI/CD Pipeline for Machine Learning: E2E Workflow

Welcome to the **CI/CD Pipeline for Machine Learning** project! This repository demonstrates the end-to-end process of developing, deploying, and maintaining a machine learning model with a fully automated CI/CD pipeline. The focus is on learning key concepts of CI/CD while building practical skills.

## 📖 About the Project

This project is designed to provide a hands-on understanding of creating and managing a CI/CD pipeline for machine learning. The process starts from **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and moves through **Data Ingestion**, **Data Transformation**, **Model Training**, **Model Deployment**, and **Monitoring**.

The key objectives of this project are:

- Automating the end-to-end workflow of ML model development.
- Incorporating best practices for reproducibility and scalability.
- Learning CI/CD tools and frameworks.

## 🛠️ Project Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   Perform data exploration to understand patterns, distributions, and correlations in the dataset.

2. **Data Ingestion**:

   - Load raw data and save it in organized formats.
   - Split the data into training and testing datasets.

3. **Data Transformation**:

   - Preprocess numerical and categorical data.
   - Handle missing values and scaling.

4. **Model Training**:

   - Train various machine learning models using preprocessed data.
   - Evaluate performance using appropriate metrics.

5. **Model Evaluation and Deployment**:

   - Save the best-performing model.
   - Integrate with deployment pipelines for production use.

6. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Automate testing, building, and deployment using CI/CD tools.
   - Monitor and improve pipelines for efficiency and reliability.
